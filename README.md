###My interest in IT
Interest in IT developed few years ago due to my brother and other family members being in IT, but I did not learn further than required. It was a general curiosity to know some basic programming and other aspects of IT. I was accepted into RMIT to learn introductory programming though I am not progressing well to the extent I'd like to. I expect to learn new concepts and developments in this field.
